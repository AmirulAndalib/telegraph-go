Telegra.ph is a minimalist publishing tool that allows you to create richly formatted posts to the Web.
Telegraph posts also get beautiful Instant View pages on Telegram. So, this Go wrapper enables you to do all that easily.

Anyone can enjoy the simplicity of Telegraph publishing, not just Telegram users. For this reason, all developers are welcome to use this Telegraph API to create bots like @Telegraph for any other platform, or even standalone interfaces and this package is to make their work easier.
